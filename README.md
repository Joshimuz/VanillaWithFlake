# VanillaWithFlake
A Minecraft datapack to make slight tweaks, restore removed/unused content, and QOL improvements to Vanilla with no mods

## Current change list:

### Crafting

- Smooth Stone now has a crafting recipe (2 Stone Slabs vertically)

- All Stair recipes now yield 8 Stairs instead of 4

- Leather now has a crafting recipe (9 Rotten Flesh)

### Loot tables

- The Ender Dragon now drops an Elytra upon death (temporary solution to End Dimension issues)

#### Maps

- Abandoned Mineshaft chests now have a chance to contain a *Jungle Explorer Map* (Jungle Explorer Map)

- Husks now have a chance to drop *Ancient Pyramid Map* (Desert Pyramid Explorer Map) when killed by a player

- Strays now have a chance to drop *Old Frozen Map* (Igloo Explorer Map) when killed by a player

- Village Blacksmith's chests now contain an *Old Mineshaft Map* (Mineshaft Explorer Map)

- Witches now have a chance to drop *Witch's Way Home* (Swamp Hut Explorer Map) when killed by a player

- Zombies now have a chance to drop *Old Mineshaft Map* (Mineshaft Explorer Map) when killed by a player

- Zombie Pigmen now have a chance to drop *Wonky Nether Fortress Map* (Fortress Explorer Map) when killed by a player

- Zombie Villagers now have a chance to drop *Villager's Map Home* (Village Explorer Map) when killed by a player

### Mobs

- Spiders and Cave Spiders now create Cobwebs periodically (Cave Spiders twice as fast as regular)

- The first time a player kills the Ender Dragon it now spawns a Dragon Egg

## Current wish-list/not possible list:

### Blocks

- Redstone Torches no longer give light updates/emit light

### Crafting

- Add Recipe for Rockets for the Recipe book (currently seems bugged due to NBT tags on Rockets)

- Smelting Iron/Gold tools yields 1 Iron Nugget per Iron Ingot used in the crafting of the original item (Two nuggets for a sword, three for a pickaxe etc)

### Mechanics

- Remove Mending, and remove the repair penalty/anvil use count for Repairing items

### Mobs

- Zombies attack Horses and turn them into Zombie Horses (same as villagers)

- Horses stuck by lightning turn into Zombie Horses
 
- Mobs (Villagers?, Humanoids?) can ride Horses as a passenger, like boats

- Shulkers respawn naturally (Over time, on killing Dragon?)

## Todo list

### Mobs

- Implement Giants (lol)

- Implement Evil Bunnies

- Implement Illusioners

- Implement Zombie Horses

- Fix Shulker rarity problem (Causes huge end worlds to be generated by players for no reason) (Possibly add End City maps?)
