# VanillaWithFlake
A Minecraft datapack to make slight tweaks, restore removed/unused content, and other QOL improvements to Vanilla with simplicity and optimisation in mind.

## Current change list:

### Crafting
- All Stair recipes now yield 8 Stairs instead of 4
- Enchanted Golden Apple now has a crafting recipe again (8 Golden Blocks surrounding a *Golden Apple*)
- Rabbit Hide now has a crafting recipe (9 Rotten Flesh, this allows 36 Rotten Flesh to be crafted into 1 Leather)
- Smooth Stone now has a crafting recipe (2 Stone Slabs vertically)

### Items
- Arrows of Blindness (0:30) are now obtainable through Illusioners *(Note: Seemingly a bug with Arrows of Blindness makes the effect duration 8 times longer than it should be, therefore the Arrows state 4 seconds in their tooltip, however they last 32 seconds)*

### Loot tables

#### General
- Ender Dragons now drop an Elytra upon death (temporary solution to End Dimension issues)
- Illusioners now drop between 1-3 (4-9 with Looting III) *Arrows of Blindness* when killed by a player
- Killer Bunnies, in addition to regular Rabbit drops, have a chance to drop Golden Carrots

#### Maps
- Abandoned Mineshaft chests now have a chance to contain a *Jungle Explorer Map* (Jungle Explorer Map)
- Husks now have a chance to drop *Ancient Pyramid Map* (Desert Pyramid Explorer Map) when killed by a player
- Strays now have a chance to drop *Old Frozen Map* (Igloo Explorer Map) when killed by a player
- Village Blacksmith's chests now contain an *Old Mineshaft Map* (Mineshaft Explorer Map)
- Witches now have a chance to drop *Witch's Way Home* (Swamp Hut Explorer Map) when killed by a player
- Zombies now have a chance to drop *Old Mineshaft Map* (Mineshaft Explorer Map) when killed by a player
- Zombie Pigmen now have a chance to drop *Wonky Nether Fortress Map* (Fortress Explorer Map) when killed by a player
- Zombie Villagers now have a chance to drop *Villager's Map Home* (Village Explorer Map) when killed by a player

### Mobs
- If a Rabbit picks up a Rotten Flesh at night during a full Moon it will turn into a Killer Bunny
- Illusioners now spawn in Woodland Mansions, for every 5 Vindicators 1 Illusioner spawns
- Spiders and Cave Spiders now create Cobwebs periodically (Cave Spiders twice as fast as regular)
- The first time a player kills the Ender Dragon it now spawns a Dragon Egg
- Withers now escape Bedrock when they reach 50% Health (This is to nerf killing Withers with Bedrock, but still allow the technique to have a use for making the fight easier and to not break redstone machines that rely upon Bedrock cages)

## Current wish-list/not possible list:

### Blocks
- Redstone Torches no longer give light updates/emit light

### Crafting
- Add Recipe for Rockets for the Recipe book (currently seems bugged due to NBT tags on Rockets)
- Smelting Iron/Gold tools yields 1 Iron Nugget per Iron Ingot used in the crafting of the original item (Two nuggets for a sword, three for a pickaxe etc)

### Mechanics
- Remove Mending, and remove the repair penalty/anvil use count for Repairing items (so lategame diamonds have meaning again, instead of using an XP farm to fix items)

### Mobs
- Mobs (Villagers?, Humanoids?) can ride Horses as a passenger, like boats
- Zombies attack Horses and turn them into Zombie Horses (same as villagers) *(and/or)* Horses stuck by lightning turn into Zombie Horses
 
## Todo list

### Effects
- Implement Bad Luck
- Implement Blindness (more)
- Implement Health Boost

### Items
- Fix Leashes (They break when far away)
- Fix Shulker Box rarity problem (Causes huge end worlds to be generated by players for no reason) (Possibly add End City maps?)
- Implement Missing Potions/Splash Potions/Lingering Potions/Tipped Arrows
- Implement Rubies

### Mobs
- Implement Giants (Probably not...)
- Implement Zombie Horses
- Shulkers respawn naturally (Over time, on killing Dragon?)
