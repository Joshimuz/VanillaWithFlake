# VanillaWithFlake
A Minecraft datapack to make slight tweaks, restore removed/unused content, and other QOL improvements to Vanilla with simplicity and optimisation in mind.

## Current change list:
### Crafting
- All Stair recipes now yield 8 Stairs instead of 4
- Enchanted Golden Apple now has a crafting recipe again (8 Golden Blocks surrounding a *Golden Apple*)
- Rabbit Hide now has a crafting recipe (9 Rotten Flesh, this allows 36 Rotten Flesh to be crafted into 1 Leather)
- Smooth Stone now has a crafting recipe (2 Stone Slabs vertically)

### Items
- Arrows of Blindness (0:30) are now obtainable through Illusioners *(Note: Seemingly a bug with custom Arrows makes the effect duration ~8 times longer than it should be, therefore the Arrows state 4 seconds in their tooltip, however they last 30 seconds)*
- Arrows of Withering (0:10) are now obtainable through Wither Skeletons *(Note: Seemingly a bug with custom Arrows makes the effect duration ~8 times longer than it should be, therefore the Arrows state 1 second in their tooltip, however they last 10 seconds)*

### Loot tables
- Ender Dragons now drop an Elytra upon death (temporary solution to End Dimension issues)
- Illusioners now drop between 1-3 (4-9 with Looting III) *Arrows of Blindness* when killed by a player
- Killer Bunnies, in addition to regular Rabbit drops, have a chance to drop Golden Carrots
- Wither Skeletons spawned wielding a bow in place of regular Skeletons in the Nether now have a chance to drop *Arrows of Withering* when killed by a player
- Added lots of Maps:
- - Abandoned Mineshaft chests now have a chance to contain a *Jungle Explorer Map* (Jungle Explorer Map)
- - Husks now have a chance to drop *Ancient Pyramid Map* (Desert Pyramid Explorer Map) when killed by a player
- - Strays now have a chance to drop *Old Frozen Map* (Igloo Explorer Map) when killed by a player
- - Village Blacksmith's chests now contain an *Old Mineshaft Map* (Mineshaft Explorer Map)
- - Witches now have a chance to drop *Witch's Way Home* (Swamp Hut Explorer Map) when killed by a player
- - Zombies now have a chance to drop *Old Mineshaft Map* (Mineshaft Explorer Map) when killed by a player
- - Zombie Pigmen now have a chance to drop *Wonky Nether Fortress Map* (Fortress Explorer Map) when killed by a player
- - Zombie Villagers now have a chance to drop *Villager's Map Home* (Village Explorer Map) when killed by a player

### Mobs
- If a Rabbit picks up a Rotten Flesh at night during a full Moon it will turn into a Killer Bunny
- Illusioners now spawn in Woodland Mansions, for every 5 Vindicators 1 Illusioner spawns
- Spiders and Cave Spiders now create Cobwebs periodically (Cave Spiders twice as fast as regular)
- The first time a player kills the Ender Dragon it now spawns a Dragon Egg
- Wither Skeletons now replace Skeletons in the Nether (Any Wither Skeletons spawned this way now wield bows)
- Withers now escape Bedrock when they reach 50% Health (This is to nerf killing Withers with Bedrock, but still allow the technique to have a use for making the fight easier and to not break redstone machines that rely upon Bedrock cages)
- When a Squid is damaged it casts Blindness on any entities around them
---
## Current wish-list/not possible list:
### Blocks
- Beacon includes Mining Fatigue effect as an option (to protect bases?)
- Redstone Torches no longer give light updates/emit light

### Crafting
- Add Recipe for Rockets for the Recipe book (currently seems bugged due to NBT tags on Rockets)
- Smelting Iron/Gold tools yields 1 Iron Nugget per Iron Ingot used in the crafting of the original item (Two nuggets for a sword, three for a pickaxe etc)

### Mechanics
- Remove Mending, and remove the repair penalty/anvil use count for Repairing items (so lategame diamonds have meaning again, instead of using an XP farm to fix items)

### Mobs
- Mobs (Villagers?, Humanoids?) can ride Horses as a passenger, like boats
- Zombies attack Horses and turn them into Zombie Horses (same as villagers) *(and/or)* Horses stuck by lightning turn into Zombie Horses
- Wither Skeletons wielding bows use Arrows of Withering (not possible due to [MC-106133](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-106133), currently the arrow is always on fire instead)
---
## Todo list
### Effects
- Implement Bad Luck
- Implement Blindness (more)
- Implement Health Boost

### Items
- Add Trident fixing recipe (Like Phantom Membrane for Elytra, or Iron for Iron Tools/Armour)(Mainly needed if Mending+Fixing Cap is removed)
- Fix Leads breaking when unloaded (If they even still/ever did that?)
- Fix Shulker Box rarity problem (Causes huge end worlds to be generated by players for no reason) (Possibly add End City maps?)
- Implement Missing Potions/Splash Potions/Lingering Potions/Tipped Arrows
- Implement Rubies

### Mobs
- Implement Giants (Probably not...)
- Implement Zombie Horses
- Shulkers respawn naturally (Over time, on killing Dragon?)
